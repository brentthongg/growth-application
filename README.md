# Growth Application

This is a small application I created in C++ to practice! It's pretty simple: it creates a text file and prompts you to enter goals that you achieved. They are stored in the file goals.txt. 

## Installation

Just clone the repo!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brentthongg/growth-application.git
```

## Usage

```bash
./a.out
```
